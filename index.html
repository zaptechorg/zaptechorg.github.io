  <p id="welcome">Hello and welcome to our entry website for the competition!</p>
  <h2>What is it?</h2>
  <p>It is a robot that is both a tutor and mental health. Not just a teacher/counciler, it's a friend! :)</p>
  <h2>Why did we decide to make this?</h2>
  <p>We decided to make this because we wanted to adress a few problems, from things such as gender inequality for girls in education (i.e. Afghanistan from the Taliban), Inaccessability to education (such as African countries) and other important reasons!
